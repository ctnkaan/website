        Welcome to my public website. Insted of an terminal website like the one
        I had before, I wanted to craft something that is minimal, efortless to
        add content to and easily readable by everyone, thus this website was
        born.

      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I majored in Management Information Systems and discovered my love for
        software craftmanship here. I thought myself software development thanks 
        to great online resources like CS50. I also even minored in Computer Science
        during my time in university. Even became a teaching assistant.

        I found my love for communities and teaching during studying. 
        Spoke at 9 tech events and hosted 17 technical workshops, 
        got accepted to developer advocate groups like Microsoft Learn Student
        Ambassadors, Google Developer Student Clubs, Postman Student Leaders,
        and IEEE Computer Society. Ended up as the 2nd Gold Microsoft Student
        Ambassador and Turkey Lead at the end. I picked up some
        awesome people skills through these communities and met with wonderful people.

        Post-Uni, I delved into web app development at MindWorks. I stayed there for 1.5 years.
        At the end I wanted more experience at a larger team, so I accepted an offer join a larger 
        software dev team. Currently I'm in the React team of MagiClick.
