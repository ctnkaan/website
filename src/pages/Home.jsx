        Welcome to my public website. Insted of an terminal website like the one
        I had before, I wanted to craft something that is minimal, efortless to
        add content to and easily readable by everyone, thus this website was
        born.

      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I majored in Management Information Systems and discovered my love for
        software craftmanship here. I practiced and basicaly thought myself
        software development online. I loved the field so much I even minored in
        Computer Science.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my 4+ years, I found my love for communities and teaching. Spoke at
        30+ tech events, joined cool groups like Microsoft Learn Student
        Ambassadors, Google Developer Student Clubs, Postman Student Leaders,
        and IEEE Computer Society. Ended up as the 2nd Gold Microsoft Student
        Ambassador and Turkey Lead. Despite being an introvert, I picked up some
        awesome people skills through these communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Post-Uni, I delved into web app development at MindWorks for 1.5 years.
        Wanted more experience, so I left to join a larger software dev team.
        Now, I'm with MagiClick, rocking it in the React Team.
